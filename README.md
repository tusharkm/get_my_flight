### Problem Targeted ->
We all know and understand the unpredictability and uncertainty of flight fares. People always seem to be in a rush to book their flights, keeping a motto of ‘the earlier you book, the cheaper you get’ alive. Well, that might not be true most of the times.

Similarly, Flight Reservation websites seem to be in mad rush to provide their customers with the cheapest flights ‘at that particular time’. Nobody seems to be bothered whether the rates will stay constant, go up in the future or maybe fall. This is the particular area we would like to do our digging/research. The possibility of rates falling in the future is momentous and we simply cannot let it go.

We are proposing to build a profile based flight recommendation system, which will predict the flight rates for a particular destination, in order to enable the user to book a flight at its cheapest rates.


### Objective ->
Find cheapest flights with our personalized/profile based flight recommender. 
 

### Actors ->
User is the sole actor of the system. User will have registration and login process. Once successful login and input of preferred dates, our system would provide the user with the best and cheapest options to book flights.
The user’s booking history and flight companies’ data will be used to create a personalized user profile by analyzing his flight schedule patterns. 
This will enable us to serve the customer better and recommend him better suggestions


## Conclusion ->
Our application is proposed to be web-based application. The application will make use deep learning and machine learning algorithms deployed as APIs, which would enable us the user to get the data instantly. IBM Watson, PredictionIO would enable us to do that. Moreover, there is a lot of scope here which we can tap on, so we are still in the process of structuring our concept.
